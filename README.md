Software-Engineering-Project
============================

Tic-Tac-Toe Unity
Using the current latest beta of Unity 4.6 RC2 as of 11/17/2014.
The project should be able to scale with all future beta. 

Make sure you open project with the right version (4.6 RC2) else you will have errors and cause issues using any older versions. 
I'll update readme to reflect changes in unity versions. 

TODO

Add Vital Game Orianted Sound Effects and Design
