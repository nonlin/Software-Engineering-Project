Software-Engineering-Project
============================

Tic-Tac-Toe Unity
Using the current latest beta of Unity 4.6 Beta 21 as of 10/25/2014.
The project should be able to scale with all future beta. 

Make sure you open project with the right version (4.6-21) else you will have errors and cause issues using any older versions. 
I'll update readme to reflect changes in unity versions.
